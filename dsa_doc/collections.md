# Collections
## List
It is a gorup of things and they have a specific order.
The order doesn't mean much, and I can add, remove elements in anypoint. Be aware that different programming languages implement them differently.
### Arrays
They are list-based collections. An array is a list with few added rules. In some languages you can have objects of the same type and in other you have elements of different type. In some languages the size is fixed and in others is not.
Each array has a location called index. Normally the index starts from 0. <br/> 
Highlights<br/>
- If you need to access a certain location in the middle the array is a good choice and you only need to keep track of the length. 
- Insertion and deletion can be more painful. Usually insertion at the end is ok, but it can be hard if it is full. If you have to insert in the middle or delete, then you have to shift the other elements and this can produce a linea complexity.
