# Typical Problems
In this chapter there is a summary about the usual technical problems.

# Shortest Path Problem
The shortest path problem is about finding the shortes path in a graph.<br/>
If the edges are weighted the shortest path is the one whose sum of the weights is the smallest as possible.<br/>
For unweighted graph the solution is the one concerning the least number of edges
