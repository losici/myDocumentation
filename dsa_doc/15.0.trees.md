# Trees
Starts from the roots and arrive to the leaves.
They have a lot of properties:
1. A tree is an extension of a linked list. While A linked list has one element at the front and a next pointer to another element, and so on.
 A tree is similar. The first element is called the root. Instead of having just one next element a tree can have several. A linked list is often drawn horizontally a tree vertically. Just like a linked list, each element on a tree contains some data.
1. a tree is vertical.

## Terminology
A tree must be:
- **completely connected**
- with no cycles (the arrow doesn't matter if everything is connected by an edge it is still a cycle and then it is NOT a tree)
- Levels: from 1 - to leaves
- Height: number of edges between the leaves(0) and the parent
- Depth: number of edges to the root(0)

Nodes are described with a parent-child relationship. Ancestor are parents, descendents are called children. Only one parent for children is admitted. If two children have the same parent they are called siblings. The children that don't have children are called **leaves**. The height starts from 0 in the first parent and it ends at the leaves. 

# Tree traversal
## DFS
If there are children notes to explore, explore them is  a priority.
### Pre-Order
We start at the root and we check we have seen it. Then we take the left children and we continue until we reach a leaf, then we go to the parent and the child and then we go up to the root.
![tree_dfs_preorder.png](/dsa_doc/imgs/tree_dfs_preorder.png "tree_dfs_preorder.png")<br/> 
The order is DBACEF.

### In-Order
we went to the nodes in order form left to right. 
We move through the node and we explore the children first. We check a node when we have seen the left child. <br/>
The order will be: ABCDEF.

### Post order
we cannot check a node until we have seen all the descendents.
The order is: ACBFED
## BFS 
the priority is to chekc the nodes on the same level and then children.

# Tree Operations
## Search
I have to check all the node. The complecity is O(n).

## Delete
Starts with a search. Depends on the position that you delete.
If you delete a leaf, it's easy. If you delete an internal node you promote the child to a parent. If you delete a node that has two children, you promote one child to parent. <br/>
Since there is search involve and some shift the run time is linear.

## Insert
Two children rule: we keep moving down the tree until we find an open spot. The worst case is that we travel until we find a leaf and this means that we travel until the height of the tree.

### Terminology break
- Perfect tree: evry node excpet the leaves on the last level have 2 children. 
- Each node has two children so every node can have twice the number of nodes of the previous level.
- binary tree: every node has 0 or two children.
- The  number of levels increases at the power of 2.

# TREE TYPES

## BST: Binary Search Tree
It is a type of binary tree with a rule about how the nodes are arranged. BST are **sorted** : every value on the left is smaller than a value in the right.<br/>
Since it is sorted we can do search, insert and delete quickly without looking at every element. To do a search you look into one value at each level of the tree and then do some comparison. So the search complecity is about the height of the tree which is O(logn). Inserting in a binary tree is the same process. You start at the top and you make quick decisions (O(logn)). Deleting is the same of the binary tree.<br/>
**Unbalanced BST**: distribution of the node is skewed on a side (there is just one breanch). Worst case for search is O(n).

## Heaps
Elements are arranged in increasing or decreasing order so that the root is the maximum or minimum element of the tree. There are two different types of heaps:
1. Max Heap: a parent must have a bigger node of the child, so the maximum is the root.
1. Min Heap: the minimum is the root. 
Operations vary based on the type of heap we are considering. <br/>

Let's consider a Max Heap with the 2-children rule and we add that the heap must be **complete**(all levels except the last one is full).
The operation of taking the peak (the max of the data) takes constant time O(1).<br/>.
**Searching** is a linear time operation. We can use the peak function doing some comparisons. Average is O(n/2) which is still like linear time. 
**Inserting** 
**Heapify** we reorder the tree based on the heap property (parent>child means do comparison ans swipe when needed)


# Heap Implementation
Heaps are implemented as a sorted array. Not every array can be represented as a Heap. It is ok if it is **ordered** and in descending order.<br/>
![heap_array.png](/dsa_doc/imgs/heap_array.png "heap_array.png")<br/> 
Implementing a Heap as an array could be more efficient than a Tree. This is because and array needs:
- value
- index
A tree node implementation needs:
- value
- pointer left child
- pointer right child
- pointer parent

# Other tree types
## Unbalanced
Nodes are spread out to many levels. The most unbalanced tree is a linked list. 
## Balanced
Nodes condensed to only a few levels.
## Self-Balanced
Try to minimize the number of levels that it uses. Insertion and Deletion are done so that the balance is kept. 
### Red Black Tree (TO BE CONTINUED)
1. Nodes are assigned with a color property: red or not.
1. Existance of no leaf node: every node that doesn't have leaves must have no children.
1. every path to a node must contain the same number of black nodes
