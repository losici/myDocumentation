# Stacks
When you most care of the recent element more quickly and recently and still keep track the order.

- Put an element in = Push O(1)
- Put an element out = Pop O(1)

LIFO = Last In First Out


# Queues

FIFO = First In First Out
First element: Head --> Dequeue: remove element from the top
Last element: Tail --> Enqueue: add element to the tail

## Priority Queue
Don't follow the rule FIFO, but each element has a priority, when you dequeue, you remove the element with the highest priority.
If the priority is the same among more elements, the oldest will be removed.
