# Hashing
## Definition
Given a key k, use a hash function to compute a number (called a hash value) that represents k . This process of using a hash function to compute a hash value for some key k is called Hashing.<br/> 
Then, we can use the hash value of k to compute an index in some array in which we will store k, which is the idea behind a Hash Table. <br>
There are many design choices that need to be made in order to design a fast Hash Table, so throughout this chapter, we will discuss the following design topics:
1. Designing a good hash function
1. Deciding on the size of the Hash Table
1. Deciding on the collision resolution strategy (i.e., what should be done when multiple keys map to the same location in a Hash Table)
