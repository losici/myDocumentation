Starts from the roots and arrive to the leaves.
They have a lot of properties:
1. A tree is an extension of a linked list. While A linked list has one element at the front and a next pointer to another element, and so on.
 A tree is similar. The first element is called the root. Instead of having just one next element a tree can have several. A linked list is often drawn horizontally a tree vertically. Just like a linked list, each element on a tree contains some data.
