# Memories

## Non Volotile
Non-volatile memory (NVM) or non-volatile storage is a type of computer memory that can retain stored information even after power is removed.
### Examples
1. Flash memory Storage
1. NAND Flash
1. ROM (Read Only Memory)
1. EPROM(erasable programmable ROM) 
1. EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable ROM)

## Volotile
In contrast, volatile memory needs constant power in order to retain data.

### Example
#### RAM
There are two kinds of volatile RAM: dynamic and static. Even though both types need continuous electrical current to retain data, there are some important differences between them.

# Glossary

## OTP
OTP (one time programmable) memory is a special type of non-volatile memory (NVM) that permits data to be written to memory only once. Once the memory has been programmed, it retains its value upon loss of power (i.e., is non-volatile). OTP memory is used in applications where reliable and repeatable reading of data is required. Examples include boot code, encryption keys and configuration parameters for analog, sensor or display circuitry.
