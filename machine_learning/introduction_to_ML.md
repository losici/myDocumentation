# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
Field of AI is the study of intelligent agents where an intelligent agent can perceive, interact and attempt to reach a goal. 

## Machine Learning
Provide to the computers the ability to learn.

There are three ways:
- supervised: trained using known answers
- unsupervised: trained without knowing the answers. In this case you look for general answers and you want a way to compress your data
- reinforcing learning: trained through the interaction with an environment 

## Data Science
Making decisions based on your data


Ways of learning:
- Active with Teacher: Reinforcement Learning - bike riding 
- Active without a Teacher: Intrinsic Exploration - exploring nature
- Passive with Teacher : supervised learning - homework
- Passive without Teacher: unsupervised learning - practice exams

## Deep learning
The model removes part of the design process to decide on which features make machine learnings.
