# Stepper Motors
Basic Operation
A stepper motor consists of a rotor (usually a permanent magnet) and a stator (made up of various coils). When electrical current flows through the stator coils, it creates magnetic fields that attract or repel the teeth of the magnetic rotor, causing the rotor to move in steps.

Types of Stepper Motors
Permanent Magnet (PM) Stepper Motors: Use a permanent magnet as the rotor.
Variable Reluctance (VR) Stepper Motors: Have a rotor made of soft iron.
Hybrid Stepper Motors: Combine features of both PM and VR stepper motors, offering better performance in terms of step resolution and torque.
Key Parameters and Formulas
Step Angle

The step angle is the angle by which the motor's shaft moves per input pulse. It is determined by the motor's physical construction.

Torque

Torque is the turning force of the motor. Stepper motors have two torque values: holding torque (when the motor is stationary but powered) and dynamic torque (varies with speed).
Resolution and Microstepping

Microstepping divides a full step into smaller steps, increasing the motor's resolution. This is controlled electronically by the driver.
If a motor is set to microstep at 1/16th of a step, the effective step angle is reduced, and the steps per revolution increase by a factor of 16.
New Step Angle = Original Step Angle / Microstepping Factor
New Steps Per Revolution = Original Steps Per Revolution * Microstepping Factor
Speed

The rotational speed of a stepper motor is determined by the rate at which it receives step pulses.

Acceleration

Often, a stepper motor must accelerate to its operating speed. This involves gradually increasing the step frequency to avoid missing steps or stalling.
Control Techniques
Full-Step Mode: Each pulse moves the motor one full step. Offers maximum torque but lower resolution.
Half-Step Mode: Alternates between full steps and half steps, increasing resolution but slightly reducing torque.
Microstepping: Further divides steps, providing smoother motion and finer control at the expense of reduced individual step torque.
Considerations for Working with Stepper Motors
Power Supply: Adequate current and voltage are necessary to achieve the desired torque and speed characteristics.
Driver Selection: The choice of driver affects performance, particularly with regard to microstepping for higher resolution.
Load Characteristics: The load attached to the motor affects its performance, including speed, acceleration, and position accuracy.
Understanding these principles and formulas will help you effectively design and implement systems using stepper motors, allowing for precise control over motion in a variety of applications.


To calculate the number of steps per revolution for a motor with a step angle of 0.36 degrees, you can use the formula:
```
# Given values
step_angle_degrees = 0.36

# Calculate steps per revolution
steps_per_revolution = 360 / step_angle_degrees
```
Let's calculate the number of steps per revolution for the given motor.
The motor with a resolution of 0.36 degrees per step has 1000 steps per revolution. ​​

## Jogging
Jogging refers to repeated starting and stopping of a motor in short bursts to perform a particular movement such as moving a crane to a particular location.

## Microstepping
Microstepping is a method used to divide the basic step of a stepper motor further into smaller steps. This is achieved by controlling the current in the motor windings in a way that allows the motor to stop at positions between the full step positions. If the AZD4A-KED driver supports microstepping and is set to a microstepping resolution that effectively divides each full step (0.36 degrees in your motor) into 10 smaller steps, it would introduce a factor of 10 in the number of steps per revolution. This would result in finer control over the motor's position, smoother motion, and reduced vibration.

## Electronic Gearing
Electronic gearing is another way a driver can introduce a factor change in the output relative to the input. In electronic gearing, the driver scales the number of input pulses to achieve a different number of output steps. This is used to synchronize the movement of the motor with another device or system. If the driver is set to a gearing ratio that effectively multiplies the input steps by 10, then for every input step the motor receives, it would move as if it had received 10 steps, thereby introducing a factor of 10 in how movement is translated from input commands to motor steps.

### Implementation
Microstepping Setting: If the AZD4A-KED has settings for microstepping, configuring it to a 1/10th microstep setting would mean that each original step is divided into 10 microsteps, effectively increasing the resolution by a factor of 10.

Electronic Gearing Ratio: By configuring the electronic gearing ratio to 10:1 in the driver settings, every command step from the controller would result in the motor moving 1/10th of its original step size.

Why Use Such a Factor?
Increased Resolution: By increasing the resolution, the system allows for finer positional control, which is crucial in applications requiring high precision.
Smoother Operation: Higher resolution through microstepping results in smoother motor operation, reducing resonance and vibration.
Application Requirements: Certain applications may require the motor to synchronize with other systems or achieve specific positioning accuracy that necessitates such a configuration.
