# Design Pattern

# Server Pattern: 
This pattern is used to create a server that handles requests from clients. The server listens for incoming requests, processes them, and sends back responses. This pattern is commonly used in networked applications where multiple clients need to communicate with a central server.

# Factory Configuration Pattern: 
This pattern involves creating a factory class that is responsible for creating instances of different classes based on some configuration. The factory reads the configuration and decides which class to instantiate. This pattern is useful for creating objects that require complex setup or initialization.

# State Machine Pattern: 
This pattern is used to manage the state of an object. The object can be in one of several states, and the behavior of the object changes depending on its current state. The state machine pattern is useful for implementing complex workflows or processes that have multiple stages.

# Callback Handler Pattern: 
This pattern involves using callback functions to handle events or actions. A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is called when a specific event occurs. This pattern is commonly used in event-driven programming, where actions are triggered by events such as user input or network activity.
