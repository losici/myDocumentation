That's not an article about how important are soft skills, you can find already plenty in the web.

Here you can find a practical approach of which words to use when you are in disagree with someone and how to handle difficult meetings.

## Talking about Technical Debt
Technical Debt is when previous software engineers implemented shitty code, or shittier than the one you are planning to implement. Handover can be painful, they are in general costly and if handled in a bad way they are even more costly.<br>
In order to be politically correct, but also keep kind-of-good working relationships use always `In my opinion` when expressing your opinion.

### Technical debts keywords
- not robust
- fragile
- unittests force to write good code
- there should be awereness about any mismatch between development software and end-user software
- test coverages and CI/CD make software development predictable. Predictable software means that it will take a predictable amount of time t develop a certain feature. This makes an happy customer
- No test coverages --> bugs --> unpredictable software development --> bugs are hard to sell to the customer

## How to end a meeting
Always end with a positive note and positive attitude questions such as:
1. Did you learn something from this?
1. Did you get something from here?

## Giving Feedback
That is a very big and difficult topic.
Some ideas:
1. Keep in mind that unless you are a manager it is not your responsibility to improve people.
1. Stick to criticize the content, and not the behavior
1. If behavior is a problem fill in a table where you count for example some faults that people did. After you ask a person if that is done on purpose or not.

## How to get what you want

### Ask questions with two wrong answers
This is a clever idea to move the problem from you to (for example) your boss. 

The Purchasing Department Example: 
I am an engineer and I want to buy this tool to satisfy quickly the request of our customer. Shall I do it by myself in oder to be quick but then not following the company policies of the purchasing department or shall I follow the policies and risk to disappoint the customer?

This answer suggests two wrong questions and it urges the person who is asked to take a position and give you an answer.
