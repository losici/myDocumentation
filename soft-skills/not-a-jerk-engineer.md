# How to NOT be a Software/Jerk Engineer
That's not an article about how important are soft skills, you can find already plenty in the web.

Here you can find a practical approach of which words to use when you are in disagree with someone and how to handle difficoult meetings.

## Talking about Technical Debt
Technical Debt is when previous software engineers implemented shitty code, or shittier than the one you are planning to implement. Handover can be painful, they are in general costly and if handled in a bad way they are even more costly.<br>
In order to be politically correct, but also keep kind-of-good working relationships use always `In my opinion` when expressing your opinion.

### Technical debts keywords
- not robust
- fragile
- unittests force to write good code
- there should be awereness about any mismatch between development software and end-user software
- test coverages and CI/CD make software development predictable. Predictable software means that it will take a predictable amount of time t develop a certain feature. This makes an happy customer
- No test coverages --> bugs --> unpredictable software development --> bugs are hard to sell to the customer

## How to end a meeting
Always end with a positive note and positive attitude questions such as:
1. Did you learn something from this?
1. Did you get something from here?
