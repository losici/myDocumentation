To do list are composed by single actions. 
A set of combined actions is a project. Divide projects into actions and always plan the next action.

Then discuss them with a team member, one is the project lead and will add/remove details from the other team members. the other team members scratch what the project lead already listed. Then decide for each action the actor and the time
