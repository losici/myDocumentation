## [.gitlab-ci.yml file](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/gitlab_ci_yaml.html)
It contains the configuration of the CI/CD. 

The scripts are grouped into jobs, and jobs run as part of a larger pipeline. You can group multiple independent jobs into stages that run in a defined order. 

The pipeline runs every time changes are pushed to any branch in the project.
