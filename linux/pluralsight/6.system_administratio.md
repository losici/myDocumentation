# Linux System Administration
## Monitoring System Resources
Why doing system performance measuring?
1. identify rogue processes
1. understand capacity usage

/proc directory contains a lot of virtual files containing system events

less meminfo contains information about capacity and usage level of your system memory

less cpuinfo tells me about cpu

top : provides a single automatic updating data containing mem and cpu %

free: you can check how much memory available you have. 

free -h gives the percentage

df -ht ext4

## monitor process events

### ps
Display any process running in the current shell

### ps aux | wc

### ps aux | grep sshd
sshd usr/sbin/sshd
