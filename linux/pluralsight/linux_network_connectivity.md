# Analyzing Network Connectivity
To be properly connected to a network a device must be identifiable by a unique ip address. 
local router might use 192.168.0.1 

```
losici@PC2094:~$ ip route show
default via 172.21.32.1 dev eth0 proto kernel
172.21.32.0/20 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 172.21.46.107
```
the part after src is my machine ip address
```
ip addr
```
ipv4: 4 8-bits numbers
Network Address Translational NAT
Ranges for private networks, devices behind a network router could share a single public IP address
192.168.10.0
172.16
ipv6: 128-bit numbers

- ipconfig
- netstat -i
show all the interfaces with usage statistics. network transfer numbers should always increase in a healthy network connection
- netstat -l 
- ss -i
# Configure DNS
every connected device --> own unique ip address

Domain Name System was created to map numeric ip address to human readable names. There is the need to database called dns server.

- host
- ping <ip_address>
```
ping 8.8.8.8
```
- show how things are configured:
```
systemd-resolve --status
```
you can check the DNS Servers file.

- hosts files that live in the hosts directory
```
losici@PC2094:~$ cat /etc/hosts
# This file was automatically generated by WSL. To stop automatic generation of this file, add the following entry to /etc/wsl.conf:
# [network]
# generateHosts = false
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       PC2094.demcon.local     PC2094

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
```

# SSH Remote sessions
The OpenSSH package which operates using the Secure Shell protocol was desifned to fix two problems:
1. access remote and virtual servors
1. how data can be secured and access

This is because:
- servers access do not have a keyboard or mouse
- they can be very distant

SSH use encryption, see image below
![Local Image](ssh.png)
- to connect to a remote host:
```
ssh username@remotehost
```
where remotehost is an ip address.
Specify a port with ip in case a ssh host use  anon standard ssh port.
```
ssh -p 2222 username@remotehost
```
- scp: secure copy to securely copy files between machines
