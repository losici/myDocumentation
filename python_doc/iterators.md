Each called of the generator function returns a generator object.<br> 
Generators asre single use objects, to recreate a generstor from a generator expression you must execute the expression again. 

## Iteration Tools
- enumerate
- sum
- itertools module (islice, count)
- any(): determines if any elements in a series are true
- all(): determines if all elements in a series are true
- zip(): sync iterations across two or more iterable series<br/>
