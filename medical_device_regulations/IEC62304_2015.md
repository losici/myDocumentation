## Understand Medical Device standards
Regulators have requirements for manufactures and they operate at government level.
If your development comply to EU and FDA then you can sell other the world.

Notified bodies, they are commercial parties and they are in between manufacturers and government i.e Dekra. Eu is more expensive, that's why many customers just go for FDA first.

Legal manufacturer is always one, and it is the one in the label. the legal is not the one that actually produces but the legal responsible for the device. 
The legal is the only part that is liable.

IN Eu you have to do proactive post market surveillance. These brought more features in the medical devices such as "logging". For example medical device needs to log the alarms.

For cybersecurity you also need to do a plan to establish how quickly they can do an update. For example a legal manufacturer need a contract with the development team to actually do an update.

In the post-market surveillance if you find a problem you need to update the risk management file, and you can see if the risk is still acceptable and in this case you don't have to do any design change. Usually if an update is needed for the new risk, the device could be nearly to the re-call, and that's another story. 

What is the minimum set of files to get CE mark?
1. Requirements
1. Architecture Design/ Design Output
1. Risks

after a couple of iterations we start verifying defining test cases for each requirement (verification).

Verification --> test pass or not pass

Validation --> more fuzzy is more related to patients. for example if the device must be wearable than we need having the device to be less than 5 kg. Also for example for clinical trial 
Validation includes usability studies, clinical trials. 

even for the most simple medical device you still need about 20 documents. 
To be lean from a documentation look at the effort to update the documentation. You need small documentation.

When to start using standards?
Regulators are not interested into feasibility. So only in a second stage you move to a formal development.

if you do a study with patients even if feasibility  then you need to be compliant to the software device standard. Then you still need to follow the IEC62304. You need at least the METC.


## How to decompose the medical device system
1. Medical device: every software in a MRI scanner is a medical device software. in this case you have also system requirements while in the second case you have user requirements and then software requirements.

2. SaMD Software as medical device, it is a medical device software

3. Non Medical Device Health Software - not regulated

1+2 are regulated. 3 is not regulated

For example an app with a control algorithm for insulin management is a medical device. 
App to track health sensors is not a medical device. Because it is not intended for that. That's why the intended use is very important and there is the need for disclaimers. 

There are also medical device software that cannot be bought, for example to do MRi acquisition. In that case you can only to a subscription. 

Epic is a cloud service database with patients dosages reports (patient records). This is not a medical device, but usually many companies just follow the iec62304. Only for Sweden in EU patient records are medical device, therefore they require local developments to follow regulations. 

Clauses

Clause 1 - 2 -3 have same kind of contents for all ISO.
Clause 4 you need to define safety class.
Clause 5 is the biggest.

Standards in general
IEC82304-1
TIR45 allows to make agile to medical device software. They actually do not care the development way waterfall or agile, the important thing is that there is good software.

IEC62304 is only talking about software verification, not validation. In the V model this covers only the sw requirements and sw verification (not user needs, intended use, system requirements and system validation and system verification)

In case you need an app you need IEC82304-1 you need to follow this process, and you need to add some of this information into the manual.

System Decomposition recipe
A software system is a piece of software that you can independently release.

Product boundaries
Only consider the medical app. 
If the OS fails in the risk analysis we have to just include the hazards: it doesn't work and it gets wrong data.

System | Sw system | Sw item | Sw unit
Auditors alway looks for software unit.
Every auditors will start with how many software system do you have?

SW unit is a code file or a function or a class. It is not in the standard. 

SOUP 
As soon as you have a limited set of lines and you can do a code review do not call it soups.

Compiler is a tool, because it is something that doesn't end up in your software. Libraries end up in your software.

The interpreter for example for python, that ends up in your software because for example with python you have all the environment.

VHDL is not covered by IEC62304, because it is a configuration file for the hardware.

quiz:
1. Medical Device software 
1. Health software may be medical device depending on the intended use (no risk)
1. soup is off the shelf software and also legacy
1. a separate risk analysis for each software item is o

## Risk Management

## Planning Management

## SW development

What is a configuration item? 
An entity that can be uniquely identified at a given reference point. 
Examples of configuration items: soups, tools
The configuration is related to the device, it is about the product. It is not about the project. 

Verify against checklist: verify that a requirement conforms to a certain checklist 

Verification is not only testing. It cna be reviewing, inspecting.
