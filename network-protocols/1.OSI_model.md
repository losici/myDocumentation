# Networking concepts
## What is data networking?
It is about transferring information. The server is connected to a network which contains data. It is a system of hardware, software protocols used to **move** information from one device to another.

# OSI Model: Open System Interconnect
It was developed in the 70s to describe network operations. It gives an exact order of the operations that must be executed. 
The chain of devices is connected by cables which do not have any specific electronics but do follow some standards. The can be also a wireless connection (without cables). The cables transfer information but they are not devices but signal themselves. <br/>
There are many types of cables:
- twisted pair cables
- CoAx cable
- fiber optics wireless

All this stuff happens at the **Physical Layer** (cables, specification for cables i.e. wireless, copper, glass).
After the physical layer there are the protocols that allow to transfer data through the cables. Example of protocols are ethernet, and they are part of the **Data link layer**. It facilitates the communication, it provides the protocols, rules and how to create a message accrossed those links (devices). Above the data layer there is the **Network layer** such as IP routing, ip addressing allows to exploit data link layer and send messages long distances. In order for a layer to communicate with another layer we need to establish a session between two devices. For example TCP - Transmission Control Protocol- and this is called **Transport Layer**, it is responsible to establish a session by using an handshake process. Next we need a way to transfer information in a usable format, for example http - hypertext transfer protocol, and htpps which is the encrypted version of it. They transfer documents written in hypertext markup language (HTML). All of this is happening outside the process of building a session between our workstations. All this is happening in the **Application Layer** which is the highest-level.<br/>
In summary there are seven layers:

- **7** Application Layer: trasfer specific type of data in a specific way
- **6** Presentation Layer - deprecated, now considered to be part of the application layer
- **5** Session Layer - deprecated, now considered to be part of the application layer
- **4** Transport Layer: establish a session between 2 endpoints
- **3** Network Layer: path that we can take through internet or network to from our client to our server
- **2** Data Link Layer: individually hops between individual client, switch, router, modem etc
- **1** Physical Layer: where we actually move the bits of information, light signals, magnetic waves.

**Presentation layer** we do not use this layer anymore, it was invented in the 70s but nowadays we do not need it. Also the **Session layer** as the previous we consider it to be part of the application layer.<br>
In summary the OSI model gives us a very precise order of operations that we can work with and it gives as a space to categorize each protocol. <br/>

# Encapsulation of OSI Model
How do the layer interact among each other for data transmission?

For each chinck of data we send there is a maximum of data that we can transfer at once. A chunck of data with the transport layer header is a segment.
![Transport Layer](/network-protocols/imgs/transport-layer.png "Transport Layer")<br/>
The segment alows the client and the server to set up a session and keep track of which data was sent and received. In order to know where we are sending this data we need to know what the sources and IP address are (where in the internet they are). The transport layer becomes the payload of the network layer.
![Network Layer](/network-protocols/imgs/network-layer.png "Network Layer")<br/>
TTL: time to live - tells us how far this packet can travel with a maximum distance. <br/>
Now we have a **Segment** inside the payload of a network layer and this is called a **Packet** (a chunck of data with a network layer header is always a packet).<br/>
To communicate with other devices we put the packet in the payload of a data link layer header which is called **Frame**, for example an ethernet layer(see "Destination MAC address").
![Data Layer](/network-protocols/imgs/data-layer.png "Data Layer")<br/>
Once we get to the cable modem we are going to use a different protocol which requires a different frame. Removing the data across the internet it means removing the packet out of the frame and putting it in a new frame. The packet will remain the frame and the frame header will change going from segment to segment. <br/>
For specific protocol such us *Ethernet* there is the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) which is 1500 bytes. We can make that larger in some cases, but usally this is the maximum included the headers. Once we have our frame built, we can take that frame and send it down the physical layer where it is converted in 1 and 0 and then those are converted to electrical signals, light signals or electro-magnetic signals in case of wireless.
