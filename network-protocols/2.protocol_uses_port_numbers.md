# Application Layer Protocols
When we want to access a website from the client side (pc) we need the hypertext transfer protocol from the server. They are called http and https from the application layer point of view and they are called *ports* from the transport layer point of view.

When using HTPPS on port 443 people will talk about SSL - Secure Socket Layer or TLS - Trasport Layer Security. They sound very different but they are the same thing. <br/>

## File transfer
When working with *file transfer* between client and server we have several options: **FTP, sFTP, TFTP**. These are all file transfer protocol. 
- FTP: Port 20/21, messy.
- sFTP: secure. It work with encryption.
- TFTP: Port 69, tipically used to transfer small files
- SMB: Server Message Block - if you work in a bussiness with a big shared drive. It mounts a drive on our windows working station.<br/>
### Example SMB drive
On the Network of the mile explorer if you right click on the *Network*, then you select *Map Network Drive*, you can see all the letters associated to the drives.

## Email
There are three methods to transfer emails:
- POP3: port 110/995 - unencrypted/encrypted
- IMAP: port 143/993 - unencrypted/encrypted
- SMTP: Simple Mail Trasfer Protocol port 25/465 - unencrypted/encrypted - used to send email from client to server

## Authentication
When we use username and passwork for a client. There are two protocols:
LDAP: Lightweight Directory Access Protocol 
LDAPs: encrypted of the above

### DHCP port 67/68
It give to the workstation an ip address which is an identifier for your device on the network. Itr has very specific processes and it must meet very specific criteria. 

## Domain Name System - DNS
It allows to take names like google.com, facebook.com and it allows us to translate the name into an ip address that we can use to transfer information at the network layer. 

## Network Time Protocol - NTP
To set the time with respect to an atomic time clock.

# SQL - Structured Query Language
SQL can be reffered to the server, the language and the protocol itself.
There are three flavours for this available:
- mySQL - open source 
- SQLnet - oracle
- SQL server - microsoft
